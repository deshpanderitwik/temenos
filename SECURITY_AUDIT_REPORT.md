# 🔒 Temenos Encryption Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The Temenos application uses client-side encryption for data privacy, but several **CRITICAL** security vulnerabilities were identified that need immediate attention. While the core encryption algorithm (AES-GCM) is strong, the implementation has significant flaws that could compromise data security.

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues

### 1. **CRITICAL: Fixed Salt Vulnerability**
- **Issue**: Using a hardcoded salt `"temenos-salt"` for all PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Risk**: Makes the encryption deterministic and vulnerable to rainbow table attacks
- **Impact**: High - could allow attackers to pre-compute keys for common passwords
- **Fix Required**: Generate random salt for each encryption operation

### 2. **CRITICAL: Environment Variable Exposure**
- **Issue**: Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENCRYPTION_KEY` exposes the encryption key to client-side code
- **Risk**: The encryption key is visible in browser dev tools and network requests
- **Impact**: Critical - completely defeats the purpose of encryption
- **Fix Required**: Separate client and server encryption keys, or move encryption to server-side only

### 3. **CRITICAL: Empty Password Handling**
- **Issue**: Empty passwords are accepted without validation
- **Risk**: Could lead to weak encryption or unexpected behavior
- **Impact**: Medium - potential for data corruption or weak security
- **Fix Required**: Add password strength validation

## ✅ Security Strengths

1. **Strong Algorithm**: Using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
2. **Good Key Derivation**: 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations (industry standard)
3. **Random IVs**: Each encryption uses a cryptographically secure random IV
4. **Proper Base64 Handling**: Robust validation and encoding/decoding
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Good exception management
6. **Non-Deterministic Encryption**: Same plaintext produces different ciphertext

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Salt Generation**
   ```typescript
   // Replace fixed salt with random salt
   const salt = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
   ```

2. **Separate Client/Server Keys**
   ```typescript
   // Server-side only
   const SERVER_ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY;
   
   // Client-side (if needed)
   const CLIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY;
   ```

3. **Add Password Validation**
   ```typescript
   if (!password || password.length < 8) {
     throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters long');
   }
   ```

### Architecture Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Move Encryption to Server-Side**
   - Only send encrypted data to client
   - Perform all encryption/decryption on server
   - Use HTTPS for all communications

2. **Implement Key Rotation**
   - Support for multiple encryption keys
   - Gradual migration of existing data

3. **Add Data Integrity Checks**
   - HMAC verification for encrypted data
   - Version headers for encryption format

## 📊 Test Results

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Key Derivation | ✅ PASS | Fixed salt vulnerability detected |
| Encryption Cycle | ✅ PASS | Core functionality works |
| Non-Deterministic | ✅ PASS | Random IVs working correctly |

## 🔍 Code Review Findings

### Positive Aspects
- Clean, readable code structure
- Proper use of Web Crypto API
- Good separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling

### Areas for Improvement
- Security configuration hardcoded
- No input sanitization
- Missing validation layers
- Inconsistent error messages

## 📈 Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Issues | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Critical** | 3 | Complete encryption bypass possible |
| **High** | 1 | Rainbow table attacks |
| **Medium** | 2 | Data integrity concerns |
| **Low** | 0 | None identified |

## 🎯 Conclusion

While the Temenos application demonstrates good understanding of cryptographic principles, the current implementation has critical security flaws that must be addressed immediately. The fixed salt and exposed encryption key are particularly concerning and should be prioritized for fixes.

The core encryption algorithm and implementation are sound, making this a fixable situation rather than a complete rewrite requirement.

**Recommendation**: Implement the critical fixes immediately before any production deployment.
